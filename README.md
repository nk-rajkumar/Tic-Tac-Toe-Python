# Tic-Tac-Toe (Python)

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows two players to take turns and play the classic game. The game checks for win conditions (rows, columns, and diagonals) and also detects ties.

## Features

- Shows whose turn it is (Player X or Player O).
- Highlights the winning combination and declares the winner.
- Declares a tie if all spots are filled without a winner.
- Allows restarting the game at any point.



## How to Play
1. Player X starts the game.
2. Click on any of the 3x3 grid tiles to mark it with your symbol (X or O).
3. After each turn, the game will check if a player has won or if the game is a tie.
4. If a player has all their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, they win.
5. The game will display the winner or declare a tie if all tiles are filled.
6. To restart the game, click the "restart" button.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
